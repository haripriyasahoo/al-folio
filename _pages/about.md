Welcome to Marine Aero- & Hydrodynamics Laboratory led by <a href="/pi/">Dr. Asim Ã–nder</a> at <a href="https://maev.nsysu.edu.tw/?Lang=en">Department of Marine Environment and Engineering</a> of <a href="https://www.nsysu.edu.tw/">National Sun Yat-sen University</a>. The lab pursues innovative fluid mechanics and CFD research to solve geophysical and engineering problems involving complex multi-phase, multi-scale flows in the marine environment.

The current research interests include:
- <b> Air-sea interactions</b>: wind-wave interactions, Langmuir circulations, gas and heat exchange
- <b> Offshore wind energy </b>: metocean characterization, aero-hydro coupling, atmospheric-stability effects, land-sea transition
- <b> Tsunamis </b>: bottom friction, sediment transport
- <b> Oceanic/atmospheric turbulence</b>: large-eddy simulation of near-surface layers, Reynolds-stress modelling, non-equilibrium turbulence
- <b> Computational science </b>: machine-learning models for interfacial flows, adjoint methods, immersed boundary methods, adaptive methods
